# Preimage vectors

Each `<name>.preimage` file is the exact canonical byte sequence that
`evidence_hash` commits to for one report, and `<name>.digest` is its SHA-256
hex digest. A third-party reimplementation of the encoding (any language) can
verify itself against these fixtures without running this repo's code.

`aqua-mainnet-onchain` is traceable to a live mainnet attestation: its digest
equals the `evidence_hash` recorded on chain and in `docs/attestation-run.md`
(tx `1b6bafc1226570b2415299f5531256716f4d8dc489a9784fcd6ea347d0f63f5f`,
asset `AQUA-GBNZILSTVQZ4R7IKQDGHYGY2QXL5QOFJYQMXPKWRRM5PAV7Y4M67AQUA`).

`network-bound-pubnet` and `network-bound-testnet` are the v3 pair: two vectors
byte-identical except for the `network` line, which is why their digests
differ. They pin the property #41 asks for — the same facts read from two
ledgers can no longer hash identically — and a reimplementation can verify
itself against both without running this repo's code.

The vectors were produced by an independent implementation of the documented
rules (`docs/contract-interface.md`), not by the Go encoder — see
`vectors_test.go`, which re-derives every vector from a Report and refuses any
vector file that is not pinned there.
