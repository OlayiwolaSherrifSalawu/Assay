// ReputationCheck folds in StellarExpert's curated reputation data and any

//
// Assay does not maintain a scam list, a rating, or a domain blocklist. Those
// exist, they are actively curated, and this check consumes them. Everything it
// produces is attributed Evidence naming the source and the URL the claim came
// from — one entry per source, so two sources saying different things stays two
// statements rather than one verdict.
//
// It is the only check permitted to escalate, and it can only ever raise the
// level. A confirmed malicious listing is decisive evidence of abuse. Absence
// from the list is not evidence of anything: most legitimate assets are absent,
// and so is every scam that has not been reported yet. The same applies to an
// asset list — presence on one is not endorsement, which SEP-0042 states
// outright, so it neither escalates nor reassures.
