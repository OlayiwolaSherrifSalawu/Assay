# verify-wasm rebuilds each contract from the committed source and checks the

# a temporary directory, so it never disturbs the artifact deploy-testnet would
# upload, and it never edits the document or submits a transaction.
#
# It exits 0 only when every recorded hash is reproduced. Until
# assay-contracts/rust-toolchain.toml exists (#127) the toolchain is whatever
# rustup has installed, which does not determine the bytes, so the run reports
# UNVERIFIABLE and exits 2. That is the honest answer, not a failure of the
# source. See docs/deployment.md ("Does the source still build what is
# deployed?").
