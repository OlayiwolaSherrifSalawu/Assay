# Assay

Mechanical trap-scanner and on-chain safety gate for Stellar assets.

Assay answers one question: **can the issuer of this asset take or freeze my
tokens after I hold them?** It answers it from the ledger's own rules — the
issuer's authorization flags — not from reputation, community reports, or a
domain blocklist.

## Live on testnet

```
Safety registry   CBK4FBIHMDTXCUPE4E3ZDVSFJSCY5FJETTKNIQPN4LFJIKKIBLKIXQ73
Network           Testnet (Test SDF Network ; September 2015)
```

`get_safety(asset)` is callable now, by any Soroban contract, atomically.
[docs/integrating.md](docs/integrating.md) has a copy-pasteable gate and a
worked example contract that is also deployed on testnet
(`CAL5VYSWLKG367D5IYGI57XH7EMN5PLJ4CD6K3MO2HJBYYKEKPG3NKRX`);
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) has the transaction hashes, the
attested assets, and the live fail-closed checks.

## Why this exists

Stellar already has a reputation layer, and Assay does not rebuild it.
StellarExpert publishes asset ratings, a curated address directory, and a
malicious-domain blocklist; SEP-0037 defines the directory format; the SCF
runs a scam-flagging process. Assay **consumes** those as attributed input
signals and never re-derives them.

What no tool in the ecosystem does is the other half:

1. **Trap mechanics from the ledger itself.** Authorization flags are
   consensus-enforced facts about what the issuer is *able* to do. They are
   true whether or not anyone has reported the asset yet, which means a
   brand-new asset with no reputation at all is still fully classifiable.
2. **An on-chain gate.** `get_safety(asset)` is designed to be callable by
   another Soroban contract, atomically, in the same transaction as the
   action it protects.

## The hard part

Detecting a flag is trivial. Judging it is not.

`auth_clawback_enabled` is not inherently malicious — it is the mechanism
regulated issuers use to meet legal obligations like sanctions enforcement
and court-ordered reversal. A scanner that paints every clawback-capable
asset red is wrong about every well-run regulated stablecoin, and a scanner
that is wrong about the biggest assets on the network gets ignored.

So Assay's engine reports **severity plus reasoning**, never a boolean, and
carries an explicit, evaluated position on legitimate clawback use. See
[docs/severity-model.md](docs/severity-model.md) for the model and
[docs/eval.md](docs/eval.md) for the labelled set it is measured against.

## Status

The mechanics engine, the HTTP API, and the on-chain gate all work. The gate is
deployed to testnet, 18 real assets have been scanned and 10 attested from live
scans, and the round trip — scan, attest, `get_safety` — is reproducible end to
end: re-checked on 2026-09-17, a fresh scan reproduced the stored `evidence_hash`
for every attested asset, with the limits recorded in
[#24](https://github.com/use-assay/Assay/issues/24).
[docs/verifying.md](docs/verifying.md) is the procedure a third party follows to
check one of those attestations from scratch, including what a mismatch does and
does not prove.

Four things are worth knowing before you rely on any of it:

- **Coverage is 10 attested assets.** Everything else on the network returns `None`.
  That is the correct answer — an asset nobody has scanned is unknown, not safe
  — but it means the registry is not yet useful as a general lookup, and a
  correctly written gate will refuse nearly everything.
- **An attestation is only as fresh as its `attested_at`.** Nothing is
  refreshing them on a schedule. Issuer flags can change after an attestation is
  written, so pass a `max_age_secs` you would actually accept rather than
  assuming someone is keeping the registry current.
  [docs/freshness.md](docs/freshness.md) measures how often flags actually
  change and recommends windows per use class.
- **This is testnet, not mainnet.** One key can write any attestation, and
  testnet is periodically reset. The live registry's entries are archived: they
  are restored on read with their original `attested_at`, and they do not read
  as missing ([docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md#entry-lifetime)). Nothing
  here is ready for money.
- **Severity is capability, not prediction.** It says what an issuer *can* do,
  never what they are likely to do. A regulated stablecoin with clawback and a
  scam with clawback score the same, on purpose — see
  [the severity model](docs/severity-model.md).
